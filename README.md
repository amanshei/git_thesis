README for cleaned thesis file directory.
The main files are notebooks, New_0910_cats_NUVRRJ_mod.ipynb and Rotate_PreGordo_cat_all_rev4_mod.ipynb, which document the steps taken, all in Pandas, to prepare the catalogs and examine and analyze the data, respectively. The other notebooks are exercises in calculating tidal force and making the Voronoi plot. The two .py files are used either to make the composite plots for the paper or contain all of the functions I wrote in Cluster_funcs which is call many times in the notebooks. The actual spectra co-adding and EW measuring and Voronoi plots are done using IDL programs that are not yet public.

It is important to note that the notebooks are static html only as displayed in github so I had to remove the cool, interactive Javascript mplD3 plots. I can provide these plots, or can re-run and upload the enabled notebooks so you can view them with notebook viewer.
